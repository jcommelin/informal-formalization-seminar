	<dd><p><b>Jelle Piepenbrock</b> (Eindhoven University of Technology), <em>Guiding Automated Theorem Proving with Machine Learning</em></p>
	<p>
		Abstract: Automated theorem provers (including first-order logic provers and SMT solvers) can be useful in many different fields, such as automated mathematics and software verification. These systems have to choose between many different possible actions when searching for a proof. We can limit the search space, by using machine learning algorithms to guide the provers. In particular, the state of the theorem prover can be processed by a graph neural network, which then predicts which actions are most promising. Examples of predictions are: which facts will be useful for a proof or which concrete terms should replace a variable during instantiation. I will talk about the work I did on this during my PhD.</p>

    <p></p>At the end, there will be a connection to ITP and formalization efforts. I also want to discuss a recently coalescing idea to create a European-wide mathematical formalization project.</p>

	<p><b>Rob Schellingerhout</b> (Utrecht University), <em>Extensional equality tactics</em>
	<p> Abstract: Type theories, like the one implemented in Lean, suffer from the drawback that equality is transportational rather than substitutional. This means that substitution along propositional equalities is not the easy operation on syntax that we are used to from ordinary mathematics. Instead, substitution is implemented by an explicit function, internal to the language itself. This can severely complicate theorem proving in proof assistants. I will discuss to what extent this issue is solvable using the resources available to us in Lean. I will propose two tactics based on Hofmann and Winterhalter's conservativity theorem of extensional type theory over intentional type theory which (at least in principle) can solve most of the problems with transportational equality.</p></dd>

	<p><b>Dick Arends</b> (Radboud University Nijmegen), <em>River: A Conversational Companion for the Waterproof System</em></p>
	<p> Abstract: To help first-year mathematics students at TU/e learn to write mathematical proofs, we have developed the educational software Waterproof, built on top of the Rocq proof assistant.
We put a large amount of effort into creating a system that is intuitive and easy to use, yet many students still struggle with Waterproof’s controlled natural language and rigid syntax.
To further support them, we have developed River: an interactive conversational tutor integrated directly into VS Code. River allows students to ask questions about Waterproof in natural language.
Crucially, because River is built on top of the Waterproof system, it can verify the correctness of its own suggested proof steps.</p>

<p>In its current experimental stage, River can generate verified hints for the next proof step, assist with Waterproof syntax, and translate natural-language proofs into Waterproof scripts. During this talk, I will demonstrate these capabilities and invite feedback on improving River’s usability, robustness, and role in an educational setting.</p>

	<p>
		Abstract: In the fall of 2024, a collection of masters and PhD students, post-docs and professors at the University of Amsterdam got together to learn about Lean and formalizing mathematics. This led to an effort to formalize a theorem of Monsky: that there exist no odd dissections of a square by equal-area triangles. The formalization was completed this summer. In this talk I'd like to reflect on the journey (and also tell you how to prove Monsky's theorem).

	<p><b>Calle S&ouml;nne</b> (London School of Geometry and Number Theory), <em>Formalizing Stacks</em>
	<p> Abstract:
		The notion of an algebraic stack is central in modern algebraic and arithmetic geometry. Part of the reason it is so important is that it provides a good setting for studying moduli spaces. Very roughly, an algebraic stack consists of a category-theoretic gadget (a stack) and a sense in which it comes equipped with geometry. In this talk, I will be discussing a joint project with Paul Lezeau, where we formalize the underlying category-theoretic notion of a stack in Lean using fibered categories. I will also discuss what I think are the key obstacles remaining before being able to define algebraic stacks in Lean.

	<p><b>Xavier G&eacute;n&eacute;reux</b> (LMU Munich), <em>Incremental Forward Reasoning for Aesop</em>
	<p> Abstract: Aesop, a white-box proof search tactic for Lean, has long supported forward rules, which derive additional facts from the hypotheses in a goal. However, the initial implementation of this feature did not scale to local contexts containing many hypotheses. A core limitation of the initial implementation was that it was stateless and so had to redo large amounts of work on each goal that Aesop produced, even though the local contexts of these goals tend to be very similar.

		I will be presenting a new, stateful implementation that takes advantage of such similarities to achieve much better performance on various examples. The new implementation is almost fully backwards compatible and is already available in Aesop. I will also be discussing examples that showcase this new implementation, as well as how Aesop’s features can be used in practice more broadly. This is joint work with Jannis Limperg (Amazon, Germany).

	<p><b>Jo&euml;l Riou</b> (Université Paris-Saclay at Orsay, France), <em>Towards simplicial homotopy theory in Lean</em>
	<p> Abstract:
	The notion of model category structure that was introduced by Quillen allows abstract reasoning about different types of objects, both in homotopy theory (topological spaces, simplicial sets, etc.) and homological algebra (complexes of modules, or more generally complexes in suitable abelian categories). In this talk, I will give an overview of a long-term goal of mine which is the formalization of the standard model category structures on topological spaces and simplicial sets, and I will discuss some ingredients towards this goal that have already been formalized in Lean: anodyne extensions, minimal fibrations, the fundamental groupoid, homotopy groups, the small object argument.

	<p><b>Pim Otte</b> (Universiteit Utrecht), <em>Tutte's theorem as an educational formalization project</em>
	<p> Abstract:
	Tutte's theorem is a core result in graph theory, which the describes conditions for existence of perfect matchings in graphs. I have formalized this theorem in Lean and it is ready for inclusion in mathlib. Additionally, I extracted a framework for educational formalization projects, based on this project that I undertook to learn more about formalization. In this talk, I will discuss the formalization of Tutte's theorem, highlighting interesting design decisions, as well as this educational framework. I propose that this framework can be applied both in traditional and community-driven educational settings and that it helps to efficiently teach formalization by minimizing teacher input.

		<p> <a href="https://people.rennes.inria.fr/Assia.Mahboubi/"><b>Assia Mahboubi</b></a> (Inria/VU Amsterdam), <em>Machine-checked diagram chasing</em>
		<p> Abstract:

		Diagrams play a central role in category theory, for they provide
such an efficient way of delivering convincing enough proofs. For instance, chasing commutative sub-diagrams in a larger diagram provides an elegant alternative to overly technical equational reasoning. Diagram chasing actually refers to a central technique in homological algebra. In this context, diagram chases over Abelian categories are used for proving the existence, injectivity, surjectivity of certain morphisms, the exactness of some sequences, etc. However, complex diagram chases only remain readable at the price of hiding non-trivial technical arguments and are, in practice, challenging to rigorously verify by hand. In this talk, we will present a work in progress towards building a computer-aided tool for writing and for verifying proofs by diagram chasing. It is based on the deep-embedding of a simple first-order language into the dependent type theory rooting proof assistants like Coq/Rocq or Lean.

This is a joint work with Ambroise Lafont (École polytechnique, France) and Matthieu Piquerez (Goethe-Universität, Frankfort, Germany).

		<p> <a href="https://mariainesdff.github.io/"><b>María Inés de Frutos-Fernández</b></a> (University of Bonn), <em>Formalizing the divided power envelope in Lean</em>
		<p> Abstract:

		Given an ideal I in a commutative ring A, a divided power structure on I is a collection of maps \(\gamma_n : I \to I\) indexed by \(\mathbb{N}\) which behave like the family \(x^n/n!\), but which can be defined even if the characteristic of A is positive. From a divided power structure on I and an ideal J in an A-algebra B, one can construct the “divided power envelope” \(D_B(J)\), consisting of a B-algebra D with a given ideal \(J_D\) and a divided power structure satisfying a universal property and a compatibility condition. The divided power envelope is needed for the highly technical definition of the Fontaine period ring B_cris, which is used to identify crystalline Galois representations and in the comparison theorem between étale and crystalline cohomology.

In this talk I will describe ongoing joint work with Antoine Chambert-Loir towards formalizing the divided power envelope in the Lean 4 theorem prover. This project has already resulted in numerous contributions to the Mathlib library, including in particular the theory of weighted polynomial rings, and substitution of power series.

		<p> <b>Andrew Yang</b> (Imperial College London), <em>Towards R = T in Lean 4: Patching</em>
		<p> Abstract:

		Patching (or "Taylor-Wiles systems") is one of the many ingenious ideas introduced in Wiles' and Taylor-Wiles' groundbreaking papers on the modularity of elliptic curves. This technique was later refined by Diamond, Fujiwara, and Kisin to simplify proofs and relax conditions on inputs. In this talk, we will outline how patching is formalized in Lean 4, building on Scholze's reformulation using ultraproducts. We will also discuss its role in the ongoing effort to formalize Fermat's Last Theorem.

		<p><a href="https://paigenorth.github.io/"><b>Paige North</b></a> (Utrecht University), <em>Perspectives on the univalence principle</em>
		<p> Abstract:

		Formalizing mathematics in UniMath (a Coq library based on univalent foundations 
		/ homotopy type theory) has one important advantage in particular: mathematical 
		structures often automatically validate the "Univalence Principle" and thus also 
		the “Equivalence Principle”. This gives formalizing categorical concepts in 
		UniMath at least one advantage over developing them in classical mathematics.
		<br>
		The Equivalence Principle is an informal principle asserting that equivalent 
		mathematical objects have the same properties. For example, group theory has 
		been developed so that isomorphic groups have the same group-theoretic 
		properties, and category theory has been developed so that equivalent categories 
		have the same category-theoretic properties (though sometimes other, ‘evil’ 
		properties are considered). Vladimir Voevodsky established Univalent Foundations 
		as a foundation of mathematics (based on dependent type theory) in which the 
		Equivalence Principle for types (the basic objects of type theory) is a theorem. 
		Later, versions of the Equivalence Principle for set-based structures such as 
		groups and categories were shown to be theorems in Univalent Foundations. In 
		[1], we formulate and prove versions of the Equivalence Principle for a large 
		class of categorical and higher categorical structures in Univalent Foundations.
		<br>
		In [2] and [3], we take a different perspective on the same phenomenon. 
		Motivated by a desire to organize the zoo of mathematical notions related to 
		double categories, we show that the different notions of double categories 
		present in the classical literature correspond to different notions of 
		equivalence between double categories. We illustrate that one can first write 
		down a definition of a categorical structure and then ask what the corresponding 
		equivalences are, as done in [1], or one can start with the desired notion 
		equivalence and design a corresponding categorical structure.

		<p> <a href="https://florisvandoorn.com/">Floris van Doorn</a> (University of Bonn), <em>The Sobolev inequality in Lean</em>
		<p> Abstract:

		When solving partial differential equations, it is easier to find so-called weak solutions,
		and then one can later prove that a weak solution is in fact an actual solution to the PDE.
		A key ingredient in this process is the Sobolev inequality.
		Heather Macbeth and I have formalized a version of the Sobolev inequality,
		namely the Gagliardo–Nirenberg–Sobolev inequality.
		In the formalization we have developed a nice technique of working conveniently with
		iterated integrals and Fubini's theorem in a product of more than two spaces,
		greatly simplifying some existing formalizations that involve Fubini's theorem in such product spaces.

	<p> Abstract:
	Fermat's Last Theorem was proved by Wiles and Taylor in the 1990s, and now there are several known routes to the summit. The question of teaching the proof to a computer proof assistant was raised in the 1990s but back then the technology was not mature enough. I now believe that it is, and in 2024 I will be leading a project to formalise the proof in the Lean proof assistant. In my talk I will explain what the landscape of computer proof assistants looks like in 2024, and I will say something about the route we'll be taking and the practicalities involved in such a large project. The talk will be a general audience talk -- no background in either the theory of proof assistants or the mathematics behind Fermat's last theorem will be assumed.

	<p> Abstract: The ring of integers of a number field K is the subring consisting of elements in K that are zeros of monic polynomials with integer coefficients. It is a central object in algebraic number theory and its explicit determination is relevant for numerous applications. Multiple algorithms exist to compute this ring, including the so-called Round 2 algorithm. In this talk, we will look into the formalization in the Lean theorem prover of the theoretical foundations for this algorithm. This includes the Pohst-Zassenhaus theorem and Dedekind's criterion, which, as we will see, also hold in a more general setting. We will then discuss a formal certificate for the ring of integers based on these results, which works locally prime-by-prime and only requires the verification of simple equalities.
