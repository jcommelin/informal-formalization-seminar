<h1>Informal Formalization Seminar</h1>

The <em>Informal Formalization Seminar</em> is a quasi-regular seminar on formalization of mathematics and adjacent subjects.
It is organized by <a href="http://www.few.vu.nl/~sdn249/">Sander Dahmen</a> (VU) and <a href="https://math.commelin.net">Johan Commelin</a> (UU).

	<p><a href="http://olivernash.org/"><b>Oliver Nash</b></a> (Imperial College London), <em>Toward the classification of semisimple Lie algebras in Lean</em>
	<p> Abstract:
	I will discuss the theory of Lie algebras as formalised in Lean's mathematics library, Mathlib.
	As often in formal mathematics, it has proved worthwhile to develop the theory
	at a level of generality beyond what is found in standard foundational texts.
	I will share some examples of the impact this has had on Mathlib.
	I will also outline approximately how much work remains
	until we can add a complete formal proof of the Cartan-Killing classification to the library.

	<p> Abstract: The ring of integers of a number field K is the subring consisting of elements in K that are zeros of monic polynomials with integer coefficients. It is a central object in algebraic number theory and its explicit determination is relevant for numerous applications. Multiple algorithms exist to compute this ring, including the so-called Round 2 algorithm. In this talk, we will look into the formalization in the Lean theorem prover of the theoretical foundations for this algorithm. This includes the Pohst-Zassenhaus theorem and Dedekind's criterion, which, as we will see, also hold in a more general setting. We will then discuss a formal certificate for the ring of integers based on these results, which works locally prime-by-prime and only requires the verification of simple equalities.

	<p><a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/k.buzzard"><b>Kevin Buzzard</b></a> (Imperial College London), <em>How to prove Fermat's last theorem</em>
	<p> Abstract:
	Fermat's Last Theorem was proved by Wiles and Taylor in the 1990s, and now there are several known routes to the summit. The question of teaching the proof to a computer proof assistant was raised in the 1990s but back then the technology was not mature enough. I now believe that it is, and in 2024 I will be leading a project to formalise the proof in the Lean proof assistant. In my talk I will explain what the landscape of computer proof assistants looks like in 2024, and I will say something about the route we'll be taking and the practicalities involved in such a large project. The talk will be a general audience talk -- no background in either the theory of proof assistants or the mathematics behind Fermat's last theorem will be assumed.
