		<p> Abstract:

		Diagrams play a central role in category theory, for they provide
such an efficient way of delivering convincing enough proofs. For instance, chasing commutative sub-diagrams in a larger diagram provides an elegant alternative to overly technical equational reasoning. Diagram chasing actually refers to a central technique in homological algebra. In this context, diagram chases over Abelian categories are used for proving the existence, injectivity, surjectivity of certain morphisms, the exactness of some sequences, etc. However, complex diagram chases only remain readable at the price of hiding non-trivial technical arguments and are, in practice, challenging to rigorously verify by hand. In this talk, we will present a work in progress towards building a computer-aided tool for writing and for verifying proofs by diagram chasing. It is based on the deep-embedding of a simple first-order language into the dependent type theory rooting proof assistants like Coq/Rocq or Lean.

This is a joint work with Ambroise Lafont (École polytechnique, France) and Matthieu Piquerez (Goethe-Universität, Frankfort, Germany).

		<p> <a href="https://mariainesdff.github.io/"><b>María Inés de Frutos-Fernández</b></a> (University of Bonn), <em>Formalizing the divided power envelope in Lean</em>
		<p> Abstract:

		Given an ideal I in a commutative ring A, a divided power structure on I is a collection of maps \(\gamma_n : I \to I\) indexed by \(\mathbb{N}\) which behave like the family \(x^n/n!\), but which can be defined even if the characteristic of A is positive. From a divided power structure on I and an ideal J in an A-algebra B, one can construct the “divided power envelope” \(D_B(J)\), consisting of a B-algebra D with a given ideal \(J_D\) and a divided power structure satisfying a universal property and a compatibility condition. The divided power envelope is needed for the highly technical definition of the Fontaine period ring B_cris, which is used to identify crystalline Galois representations and in the comparison theorem between étale and crystalline cohomology.

In this talk I will describe ongoing joint work with Antoine Chambert-Loir towards formalizing the divided power envelope in the Lean 4 theorem prover. This project has already resulted in numerous contributions to the Mathlib library, including in particular the theory of weighted polynomial rings, and substitution of power series.

		<p> <b>Andrew Yang</b> (Imperial College London), <em>Towards R = T in Lean 4: Patching</em>
		<p> Abstract:

		Patching (or "Taylor-Wiles systems") is one of the many ingenious ideas introduced in Wiles' and Taylor-Wiles' groundbreaking papers on the modularity of elliptic curves. This technique was later refined by Diamond, Fujiwara, and Kisin to simplify proofs and relax conditions on inputs. In this talk, we will outline how patching is formalized in Lean 4, building on Scholze's reformulation using ultraproducts. We will also discuss its role in the ongoing effort to formalize Fermat's Last Theorem.

		<p> Abstract:

		The étale fundamental group of a scheme is an important tool in algebraic geometry and its underlying categorical framework is the notion of a Galois category. In my talk I will discuss the setup that is implemented in Mathlib and give an overview on the recently completed formalization of the main theorem on Galois categories. I will also give an outline on the next steps towards a formal proof of the fundamental exact sequence on arithmetic and geometric fundamental groups.

		<p><a href="https://paigenorth.github.io/"><b>Paige North</b></a> (Utrecht University), <em>Perspectives on the univalence principle</em>
		<p> Abstract:

		Formalizing mathematics in UniMath (a Coq library based on univalent foundations 
		/ homotopy type theory) has one important advantage in particular: mathematical 
		structures often automatically validate the "Univalence Principle" and thus also 
		the “Equivalence Principle”. This gives formalizing categorical concepts in 
		UniMath at least one advantage over developing them in classical mathematics.
		<br>
		The Equivalence Principle is an informal principle asserting that equivalent 
		mathematical objects have the same properties. For example, group theory has 
		been developed so that isomorphic groups have the same group-theoretic 
		properties, and category theory has been developed so that equivalent categories 
		have the same category-theoretic properties (though sometimes other, ‘evil’ 
		properties are considered). Vladimir Voevodsky established Univalent Foundations 
		as a foundation of mathematics (based on dependent type theory) in which the 
		Equivalence Principle for types (the basic objects of type theory) is a theorem. 
		Later, versions of the Equivalence Principle for set-based structures such as 
		groups and categories were shown to be theorems in Univalent Foundations. In 
		[1], we formulate and prove versions of the Equivalence Principle for a large 
		class of categorical and higher categorical structures in Univalent Foundations.
		<br>
		In [2] and [3], we take a different perspective on the same phenomenon. 
		Motivated by a desire to organize the zoo of mathematical notions related to 
		double categories, we show that the different notions of double categories 
		present in the classical literature correspond to different notions of 
		equivalence between double categories. We illustrate that one can first write 
		down a definition of a categorical structure and then ask what the corresponding 
		equivalences are, as done in [1], or one can start with the desired notion 
		equivalence and design a corresponding categorical structure.

		<p> <a href="https://florisvandoorn.com/">Floris van Doorn</a> (University of Bonn), <em>The Sobolev inequality in Lean</em>
		<p> Abstract:

		When solving partial differential equations, it is easier to find so-called weak solutions,
		and then one can later prove that a weak solution is in fact an actual solution to the PDE.
		A key ingredient in this process is the Sobolev inequality.
		Heather Macbeth and I have formalized a version of the Sobolev inequality,
		namely the Gagliardo–Nirenberg–Sobolev inequality.
		In the formalization we have developed a nice technique of working conveniently with
		iterated integrals and Fubini's theorem in a product of more than two spaces,
		greatly simplifying some existing formalizations that involve Fubini's theorem in such product spaces.

	<p> Abstract:
	Fermat's Last Theorem was proved by Wiles and Taylor in the 1990s, and now there are several known routes to the summit. The question of teaching the proof to a computer proof assistant was raised in the 1990s but back then the technology was not mature enough. I now believe that it is, and in 2024 I will be leading a project to formalise the proof in the Lean proof assistant. In my talk I will explain what the landscape of computer proof assistants looks like in 2024, and I will say something about the route we'll be taking and the practicalities involved in such a large project. The talk will be a general audience talk -- no background in either the theory of proof assistants or the mathematics behind Fermat's last theorem will be assumed.

	<p> Abstract:
	I will discuss the theory of Lie algebras as formalised in Lean's mathematics library, Mathlib.
	As often in formal mathematics, it has proved worthwhile to develop the theory
	at a level of generality beyond what is found in standard foundational texts.
	I will share some examples of the impact this has had on Mathlib.
	I will also outline approximately how much work remains
	until we can add a complete formal proof of the Cartan-Killing classification to the library.

	<p><a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/alain-chavarri-villarello"><b>Alain Chavarri Villarello</b></a> (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam), <em>Formally certifying rings of integers in Lean</em>
	<p> Abstract: The ring of integers of a number field K is the subring consisting of elements in K that are zeros of monic polynomials with integer coefficients. It is a central object in algebraic number theory and its explicit determination is relevant for numerous applications. Multiple algorithms exist to compute this ring, including the so-called Round 2 algorithm. In this talk, we will look into the formalization in the Lean theorem prover of the theoretical foundations for this algorithm. This includes the Pohst-Zassenhaus theorem and Dedekind's criterion, which, as we will see, also hold in a more general setting. We will then discuss a formal certificate for the ring of integers based on these results, which works locally prime-by-prime and only requires the verification of simple equalities.
